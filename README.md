# Terraform Infrastructure Project for GCP (Example)

This Terraform project is designed to manage the infrastructure of a GCP-based organization using modular and scalable practices. The directory structure is organized to support multiple environments, services, and global configurations.


### Environments

This folder contains configurations specific to each environment (e.g., prod, stg, dev). Each environment has its own set of Terraform state files and backend configurations to maintain isolation.

### Global

The `global` folder contains configurations and resources that are shared across the entire organization. Examples include global monitoring configurations and networking settings. This folder is further divided into sub-folders for different aspects of the global configuration.

### Services

This folder contains Terraform configurations and resources for specific services (e.g., compute, storage). These service-specific configurations are separated into sub-folders, making it easier to manage and maintain resources.

## Usage

To deploy resources in a specific environment, follow these steps:

1. Change to the target environment directory (e.g., `cd environments/stg` for the staging environment).
2. Initialize Terraform by running `terraform init`.
3. Review the plan by running `terraform plan`.
4. Apply the changes by running `terraform apply`.

Please note that some resources or configurations may require additional setup or input variables. Consult the README files in the relevant service or environment directories for more information.

## Contributing

To contribute to this project, create a feature branch with your changes and submit a pull request for review. Please follow the existing directory structure and coding conventions.
