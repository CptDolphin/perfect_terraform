n a large-scale organization like Netflix, the infrastructure is likely to be quite complex and involves numerous applications, environments, and teams. While it is impossible to determine the exact structure used by Netflix, we can provide an example of how a Terraform project might be structured for a company of that size.

└── modules/
    ├── gke/
    ├── networking/
    ├── compute/
    └── ...

Here's a brief explanation of the structure:

    global/: This folder contains configurations and resources that apply to the entire organization, such as monitoring, logging, and security policies.

    accounts/: This folder has separate directories for managing different GCP accounts or projects used for development, staging, and production.

    environments/: This folder holds separate directories for each environment (e.g., dev, stg, prod), with each environment having subdirectories for individual applications. Inside each application folder, you'd have environment-specific Terraform configurations and variable files.

    modules/: This folder contains reusable Terraform modules for various infrastructure components, such as GKE, networking, and compute resources.

For security, a company like Netflix would likely implement the following measures:

    Use dedicated accounts or projects per environment to enforce the separation of concerns and limit the blast radius of potential issues.

    Follow the principle of least privilege for IAM roles and permissions, granting only the necessary access to users, groups, and service accounts.

    Encrypt data at rest and in transit, making use of encryption features offered by GCP services, and manage encryption keys using Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS).

    Implement robust logging and monitoring solutions to ensure visibility, auditing, and quick detection of security incidents.

    Use private clusters in GKE and configure network policies to limit ingress and egress traffic between namespaces and applications.

    Enforce a strong authentication and authorization model in GKE using Google Groups for RBAC and features like Workload Identity for service accounts.

    Use a secure remote backend for storing Terraform state, with encryption and access controls enabled.

In order to deploy GKE clusters in multiple environments, you would create a reusable GKE module and use it within the appropriate environment folders, providing environment-specific variable values. This approach ensures that the same underlying infrastructure is deployed across environments, while still allowing for customization as needed.

It's important to note that this is just an example, and a real-world Terraform project structure would vary based on an organization's specific needs, applications, and workflows. However, the key principles of modularity, separation of concerns, and proper management of environments and resources should be maintained.
