In a large-scale organization like Netflix, the global folder would contain configurations and resources for monitoring that are applicable across the entire organization. It's important to note that the actual monitoring configuration used by Netflix might be different, but here's an example of how a global monitoring folder could be structured:

csharp

global/
└── monitoring/
    ├── alerting_policies/
    ├── dashboards/
    ├── modules/
    │   ├── custom_metric/
    │   └── uptime_check/
    ├── main.tf
    ├── providers.tf
    └── variables.tf

    alerting_policies/: This folder would contain configuration files for creating global alerting policies based on predefined metrics and thresholds.

    dashboards/: This folder would store JSON configuration files for global monitoring dashboards that provide an overview of the infrastructure and application health.

    modules/: This folder would contain custom Terraform modules for creating specific monitoring resources, such as custom metrics or uptime checks.

    custom_metric/: This module could be used to create custom metrics for collecting and aggregating non-standard metrics that are specific to the organization's applications.

    uptime_check/: This module might be used to create uptime checks for monitoring the availability of critical services within the organization.
